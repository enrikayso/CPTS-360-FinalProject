# CS360-Final
The final project in CS360 @ WSU 2020
This public repository serves as the work put forward by myself and my partner in the 3 function level final lab of 
Professors K.C Wang's Systems Programming Class in the fall of 2020.

It contains the full set of required functions from level 1 - level 3 as of December 2020. 

Its purpose is to aid and inform upcoming students in the usage of the EXT2 standard in order to fill in any gaps left by the textbook.  

Any direct copying or resubmission of this work is NOT condoned by myself and would be considered a violation of WSU's acedemic honesty policy.
